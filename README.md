# OpenDomain
### OpenDomain is an open-source Javascript library for detecting top level page url in browser from underlying iframes.
This is especially handy for ad-tech (advertisement technology) when js code in your ad tag could be executed from within multiple layers of iframes. You will want to know an actual URL of the page that is opened in a browser. 
# Basic usage
Add the following code to your html page or try opening our [index.html](index.html)
```
<script src="opendomain.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript">
  console.dir(com_genesismedia_utils_DOCUMENT_INFO);
</script>
```


# Who made it?
OpenDomain is cooked by [Genesis Media](http://www.genesismedia.com/), one of the leaders in video advertisment technology.
# Can I contribute?
You should! PRs, Issues are welcome!
